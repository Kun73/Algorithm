We consider computational algorithms generating random numbers. These algorithms can produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or key. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a pseudorandom number generator(PRNG)[(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation#%22True%22_vs._pseudo-random_numbers).

Suppose we have attained $U(0,1)$. 

# Inverse CDF

For a continuous distribution function $F$, we can generate a series of random numbers distributed as $F$ by $X=F^{-1}(u),u\sim U(0,1)$
\begin{align}
P(X\leq x) &= P(F^{-1}(u)\leq x)\\
&= P(u\leq F(x))\\
&= F(x)
(\#eq:invCDFc)
\end{align}

However, when $F$ is discrete, we do not have $F^{-1}$. For this situation, we can define the generalized inverse of $F$ as 
\begin{equation}
F^{-}(u) = \inf{x: F(x)\geq u}
(\#eq:gF)
\end{equation}

Then, similar as \@ref(eq:invCDFc), we can generate a random number distributed as $F$ by $X=F^{-}(u),u\sim U(0,1)$.
